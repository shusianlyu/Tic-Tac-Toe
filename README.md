# tic-tac-toe

### About
A simple two-player tic-tac-toe game built with python.

### How does the game work?
This game allows each player to choose their their own position (number 1-9 corresponds with a number on a number pad) to place your marker. Whoever gets three his/her markers in a row wins the game. Or if all 9 squares are full but no one has three in a row, the game is over!
